i manage mine with [gnu stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), a free, portable, lightweight symlink farm manager. this allows me to keep a versioned directory of all my config files that are virtually linked into place via a single command. this makes sharing these files among many users (root) and computers super simple. and does not clutter your home directory with version control files.

#installing
stow is available for all gnu/linux and most other unix like distributions via your package manager.

- `sudo pacman -S stow`
- `sudo apt-get install stow`
- `brew install stow`

#how it works
by default the stow command will create symlinks for files in the parent directory of where you execute the command. so my dotfiles setup assumes this repo is located in the root of your home directory `~/dotfiles`. and all stow commands should be executed in that directory. otherwise you'll need to use the `-d` flag with the repo directory location.
